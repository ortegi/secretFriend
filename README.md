# SecretFriend:ghost:

This is a JavaScript vanilla application for organizing a Secret Friend :gift: exchange. 

It allows users to generate a unique code for their gift exchange and share it with their friends through WhatsApp. 
Participants can then use the code to join the exchange and input their own information, including their name and the name of the person they have drawn. 
The organizer can see a list of all participants and then randomize all the names of the persons so every person has to give a gift to one person assigned at random.
